📌 About the Repository

This repository showcases a complete pipeline for classification using multiple ML models, covering:

✔️ Logistic Regression

✔️ Support Vector Machine (SVM) using linear, rbf, and polynomial kernel

✔️ Bagging Classifier

✔️ Boosting Techniques (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost)

✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)

✔️ Cross-validation & unified performance comparison

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Also, this repository provides complete implementations of unidirectional and bidirectional recurrent neural network models for text classification, trained on the Reuters dataset.
It serves as an educational and experimental platform for understanding the behavior of:

🔹 SimpleRNN

🔹 LSTM

🔹 GRU

🔹 Bidirectional SimpleRNN

🔹 Bidirectional LSTM

🔹 Bidirectional GRU

The project includes:
✔ Preprocessing
✔ Tokenization & Padding
✔ Model Building
✔ Training & Validation
✔ Performance Comparison
✔ Visualization (accuracy, loss)
